What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It prepares the structure a git repository has (additional files for history, etc)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate level, where you gather and organise the changes you want to carry from the working directory into the repository

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can organize the files changed that the logical change comprises of. Each time, I can add to the staging area only the files that make up one logical change, and then commit these.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When I want to try new features, or when I want to label a version that has significant changes over other versions

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

You understand better what is reachable from where, and relationships between commits/branches in general.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
Changes in both branches are included in the merged one (the one that is checked out)


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

With Git's automatic merging you save a lot of time, however you don't always have the result you want to have.
With manual merging you have complete control of what will be in the merged version, however you require a lot more effort and time.
